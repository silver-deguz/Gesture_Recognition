# Gesture_Recognition

Given a collection of hand gesture training images, we design a classification model that learns to distinguish between the different gestures when given new images. This problem has widespread application in areas such as ASL translation and driver/pedestrian hand recognition for safe and smart driving. As of recently, deep learning has seen tremendous growth in different computer vision and machine learning applications from image classification and segmentation to object detection and recognition. Therefore, we decided to apply deep learning methods to the problem of hand gesture recognition. We implement a convolutional neural network (CNN) that takes in images of 10 different hand gestures and outputs the predicted gesture type. Although our model is more simple in that it learns to recognize only 10 hand gestures, it can easily be scaled up to learn a larger number of hand gestures and signs.
